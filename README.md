# shells
A script for generating common revshells fast and easy. <br>
Especially nice when in need of PowerShell and Python revshells, which can be a PITA getting correctly formated.<br><br> 

## PowerShell revshells<br> 
- Shows username@computer, above the prompt and working-directory
- Has a partial AMSI-bypass making some stuff a bit easier, like loading a full AMSI bypass.
- TCP and UDP shells 
- Windows Powershell and Core Powershell
- Functions for uploading and downloading files. (Using [Updog](https://github.com/sc0tfree/updog) by sc0tfree)

## ngrok support
- ngrok can be started/stopped from inside the script
- payloads will be genereated with the ngrok addresses

## Updog support
- you can start/stop Updog from inside the script
- The PowerShell revshells have upload/download function embedded
- To upload from nix using curl: 
```curl -F path="absolute path for Updog-folder" -F file=filename http://UpdogIP/upload```
